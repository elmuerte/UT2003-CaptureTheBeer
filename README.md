# UT2003-CaptureTheBeer

An excelent beer game. It's based on CTF, but instead of flags you have to capture a beer crate. But time is important, while you are carrying the crate you will consume the beer until you're out. Ofcourse the beer will have it's effect on you.

Finalist in the Make Something Unreal Contest.
